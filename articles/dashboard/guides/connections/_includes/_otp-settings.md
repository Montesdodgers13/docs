5. Adjust settings for your **OTP Expiry** and **OTP Length**.

| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| OTP Expiry | The amount of time before the one-time password expires |
| OTP Length | The length of the one-time password sent to the user |

If you choose to extend the OTP expiry time, we recommend increasing the OTP length for security reasons. Otherwise, the malicious party has a longer time frame to try to guess an OTP that is shorter in length.
