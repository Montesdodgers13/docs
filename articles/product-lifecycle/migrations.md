# Migrations

We are actively migrating customers to new behaviors for all **Deprecations** listed below. Please review these carefully to ensure you've taken any necessary steps to avoid service disruptions. See [Deprecation and End Of Life](/product-lifecycle/deprecation-eol) to learn more about this process.

      <td>To provide our customers with the most reliable and scalable solution, Auth0 has deprecated Tenant Logs Search Engine v2 in favor of v3. Auth0 is proactively migrating customers unaffected by this change, while those who are potentially affected are being notified to opt in for v3 during the provided grace period.  See the <a href="/logs/migrate-logs-v2-v3">migration guide</a> for more information.</td>
